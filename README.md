# Easy21RL
## Attempt at the UCL 2015 David Silver Reinforcement Learning Course Assignment
I did not attend UCL in 2015, this is just my attempt to practically implement the course material. Credit to some parts of https://github.com/timbmg/easy21-rl as it helped guide me along in places where I made small mistakes as well as more efficient python syntax and commands.
